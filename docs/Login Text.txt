You will be soon connected soon, we just have a few questions.

Why do you want to get online?

[I want to check social media]
[I'm waiting for something/someone and want to look busy]
[I'm working on something important]

Take a look around you. What do you see?

Take a second and really look. Are there people? What are they doing?

What are you sitting on? What is it made of? How does it feel?

How are you feeling? Did you have a hard day? 

Take a minute to think about it.
